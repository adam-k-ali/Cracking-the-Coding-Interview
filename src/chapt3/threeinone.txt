Each stack would have a capacity 1/3 of the capacity of the array.

We have 6 pointers, one for the bottom of each stack, and one for the top of each stack (i.e. the next available position in the stack).

If we try to push an element onto a stack that is full, we can either throw an exception or refuse to push the element.

When we pop an element from a stack,
    if the stack is empty, we can either throw an exception or return null.
    or decrement the top pointer and return the element at the new top pointer, as well as setting the element at the old top pointer to null.
